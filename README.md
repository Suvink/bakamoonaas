```
2. Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"

If your browser does not support having the package manager inside source files, run the following command to generate the `dist` folder:
```bash
npm run build
```
if you don't have `npm` installed, run the script manually:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.js && node scripts/build.js
```
After running the script, you can load the `dist` folder instead of the source folder in step 4.
